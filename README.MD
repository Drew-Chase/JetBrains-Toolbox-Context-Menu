# JetBrains Toolbox Context Menu Documentation

The application serves as an interface between the JetBrains Toolbox and your Windows Explorer context menu. It automatically lists all of your installed JetBrains tools in the context menu for easy access.

## Running the Program
**You can double-click on the executable**, or you can open a command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the executable. Run the program by typing the executable name and hitting enter.

cd C:\path\to\executable\
.\"JetBrains Toolbox Context Menu.exe"

Note that you must replace `C:\path\to\executable\` with the actual path to the executable.
